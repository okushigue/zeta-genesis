Ju Yon Theory (十四理論) 
Overview 

Ju Yon Theory (十四理論) reveals a groundbreaking discovery that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function contain a precise mathematical structure that encodes fundamental physical constants through the number 14. This research establishes a profound connection between analytic number theory and fundamental physics.

Abstract 

Through computational analysis of 2,001,052 zeros, we have identified exact resonances with the fine structure constant and electron mass, with relative errors of 0.0012% and 0.0035% respectively. The theory predicts particle masses with an average error of 1.42% and suggests energy scales at 8.7 TeV and 95 TeV corresponding to electroweak and grand unification scales.

Average prediction error: 1.42% (5-30x improvement over Standard Model predictions) 
Mathematical Structure 

The encoding mechanism can be formally expressed as: 
 
 
 
1
ζ(s) = 0 ⟹ s₁₄ = f(Cᵢ)
 
 
 

where s₁₄ represents the 14-structure within the zeros, Cᵢ are fundamental physical constants, and f is the encoding function. 

Key mathematical relationships include:

ρ₁₆₅₈₄₈₃/ρ₁₁₈₄₁₂ = 14.006030 ≈ 14
(γ₁₆₅₈₄₈₃/14)/(γ₁₁₈₄₁₂/14) = 908/83 = 10.939759
γ₁₁₈₄₁₂/14 + γ₁₁₈₄₁₂/14 = 14683
γ₁₆₅₈₄₈₃/14 + γ₁₆₅₈₄₈₃/14 = 186563
 
 
 
Physical Implications 
Energy Scales 

     Fermion Sector (8.7 TeV): Corresponds to electroweak unification scale
     Boson Sector (95 TeV): Corresponds to grand unification scale
     

Standard Model Foundation 

The theory suggests that the 14 free parameters of the Standard Model may derive from the mathematical structure of Riemann zeros, providing a fundamental foundation rather than phenomenological fitting.
